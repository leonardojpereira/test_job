# JSProject

These projects were made in order to test my developer skills.

### 📋 Requirements and Instalation

To view this application, extract the files after downloading from github, and with the terminal open in the project, type node (name of the file).js, as in the example below: 

```
node Exercise3.js
```

*(If you don't have node installed, follow the tutorial: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows)*

This command will open a new browser window with the project already running.

## 🛠️ Made with
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - Coding Editor
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
